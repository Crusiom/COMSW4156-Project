# Naming

1. to ensure no surprise: file/folder names that are noun-phrases will be in plural forms, e.g. controllers, Users.js ...
   Exception: ./server.js, ./middelwares/error.js, ./helpers/errResponse.js
2. font wise: all in camelCase except for those defined under the `models` directory, which are capitalized.
